# PHP-Amortizaton-Table
basic mortgage amortization table utilizing very simple PHP coding.

$_POST values from the post_inputs.php file passes user input to the amortCalc.php file. 
You can eliminate the post_inputs.php file by just putting all of the $_POST values in the top of the index.php file, if you would like.
amortCalc.php does the calculations and uses a loop to display the amortization table.

the CSS is clunky and just gets the job done.

not all calculation scenarios have been tested, but I have not encountered any errors so far.
